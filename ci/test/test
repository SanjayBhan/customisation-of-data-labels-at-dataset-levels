# This script is intended to be executed as all-inclusive test and artefact creation (excluding packaging and release.)
# As such, a clean exit from this script implies all tests have passed and the code will not fail a build. (However,
# build may still fail due to errors on build executing servers and as such has no relation with code quality.)
#
# This script executes all non time-bound tests, excluding browser tests and performance tests.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Stop on first error
set -e;

# The following needs to be executed for artefact creation
# --------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Lint source files
# 2. Preprocess and build files
npm run-script lint;
npm run-script build;
